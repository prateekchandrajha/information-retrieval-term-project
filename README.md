Code Structuring, Reports and Suggested Order of Perusal:

- The project proposal/abstract including a short intro is available in the IR-Project-Proposal-MDS201922-MDS201928-Attention-NMT-BERT.pdf PDF file
- The complete project report explaining each and every component of the project is available in the Info-Ret-Project-Attention-NMT-REPORT.pdf file

- We introduce the lightweight Trax library maintained by Google Brain team for building deep learning models with clear, concise code and much needed speed in IR_project_google_brain_trax_library_intro.ipynb Jupyter Notebook
- Then we move on to demonstrate the advantage of stack oriented nature of the Trax Layers in IR_project_Stack_Semantics_Trax.ipynb Jupyter Notebook
- Then we move on to implementation from scratch of BLEU Score and further explanations in IR_project_Bleu_Score_Implementation.ipynb Jupyter Notebook
- Further on, we move on to the implementation from scratch of Neural Translation Model using Attention Mechanism in IR_translation_retrieval_attention_mechanism.ipynb Jupyter Notebook
- Finally we demonstrate via implementation of 3 Ways of Attention using Dot-Product Attention Mechanism (a short demo) in IR_project_attention_mechanism_demo.ipynb Jupyter Notebook
